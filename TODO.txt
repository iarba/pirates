Model: a game contains 1 object
  objects are split into layers based on dependency
    layer0 - world - an ocean made entirely out of water
    layer1 - floater - floats on water - interacts with other floaters
    layer2 - solid - interacts with other solids, move on floaters
    layer3 - attachments

world is gridless - eases movement but makes collision complex - stick to simple shapes
floater is gridded for object placement, but movement is gridless. Objects will allign with target grid

grid - square grid

advantages - seamless movement improves user experience

expected difficulty - unalligned grid interaction
